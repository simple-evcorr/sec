SEC (Simple Event Correlator) 2.9.3

Introduction:
-------------
SEC is an event correlation tool for advanced event processing which can be 
harnessed for event log monitoring, for network and security management, for 
fraud detection, and for any other task which involves event correlation.
Event correlation is a procedure where a stream of events is processed, 
in order to detect (and act on) certain event groups that occur within 
predefined time windows. Unlike many other event correlation products which 
are heavyweight solutions, SEC is a lightweight and platform-independent 
event correlator which runs as a single process. The user can start it as a
daemon, employ it in shell pipelines, execute it interactively in a terminal, 
run many SEC processes simultaneously for different tasks, and use it in a 
wide variety of other ways.

Release Notes:
--------------
SEC has been tested primarily on Linux and Solaris, but since it is written 
in Perl and does not use any platform dependent subroutines, it should also
work on other OS platforms.
Because SEC is not tested against ancient Perl releases, it is recommended 
to run SEC with at least Perl 5.8 (see https://www.perl.org for the latest 
stable release). 
SEC uses Perl Getopt, POSIX, Fcntl, Socket, IO::Handle, Sys::Syslog, and 
JSON::PP modules which are included in the standard Perl installation 
(the presence of Sys::Syslog and JSON::PP is optional).
